# smart-cane

This goal of this project was to make a robotics navigation solution for the visually impaired. The cane provides real-time navigation through haptic and audio feedback. LiDAR was used for obstacle detection and computer vision was used for sign recognition. This repository summarizes the design, prototyping, and testing process of "Smart Cane".
